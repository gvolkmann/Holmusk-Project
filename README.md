# Holmusk-Project

The goal of this project was to find the variables driving the cost of hospital bills. The data analyzed in this project included 3 datasets with various data about patient demographics, medical histories, symptoms, and date of admission and discharge. These datasets were merged and irrelevant data that did not have an effect on bill amounts, such as bill id, were dropped. 
The provenance of the data was not provided. Values that differed slightly in the dataframe but were supposed to signify the same information were updated: for example, in the race column "chinese" was updated to "Chinese". There were 13,600 individual bills and 3000 individual patients indicating there are patients that have been admitted multiple times. I calculated age of the patient and length of stay as these are variables that can often influence the cost of care. I also looked at the day of the week and the month of the year that patients were admitted as seasonality can influence cost of care for certain illnesses. There were missing values for medical history 2 and medical history 5, which I replaced with 0 as I did not want to drop this data and there were few enough missing values that I did not think it would affect the data analysis.
