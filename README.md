# Holmusk-Project

The goal of this project was to find the variables driving the cost of hospital bills. The data analyzed in this project included 3 datasets with various data about patient demographics, medical histories, symptoms, and date of admission and discharge. These datasets were merged and irrelevant data that did not have an effect on bill amounts, such as bill id, were dropped.
